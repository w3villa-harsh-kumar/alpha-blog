You can create, read, update and destroy items for a resource and these operations are referred to as CRUD operations. The terms used for a resource are as follows: 1. Model: The model is the class that describes the resource. It contains the attributes and methods to manipulate the resource. 2. View: The view is the HTML representation of the resource. It is the user interface. 3. Controller: The controller is the class that contains the actions to manipulate the resource. It is the interface between the user, the view and the model. 4. Database: The database is the storage for the resource. It is used to store the data for the resource. It can be a relational database such as MySQL or a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. It contains the tables for the resource.",
