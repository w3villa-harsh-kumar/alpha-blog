Q1. What is the difference between .find() and .find_by() in Rails?
A. find_by() is a dynamic finder method that allows you to find a record by a specific attribute. For example, if you have a User model with a name attribute, you can find a user by name by using the find_by_name() method. find() is a method that allows you to find a record by id. For example, if you have a User model, you can find a user by id by using the find() method.
