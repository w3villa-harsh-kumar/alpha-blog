// What is this file for?
// This file is used to tell the asset pipeline what files to include in the compiled assets. 
// You can add additional files to include in the manifest, as well as dependencies that are required in all JavaScript files.
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
// You're free to add application-wide JavaScript/Coffee code to this file, but it's generally better to create separate JavaScript/Coffee files as needed.
// This file is picked up by Sprockets and should be regenerated when new assets are added to the project.
// Manifest files are used to tell Sprockets which files to include in the compiled version of your assets bundle.
// You can add additional files to your compiled bundle using these directives.
